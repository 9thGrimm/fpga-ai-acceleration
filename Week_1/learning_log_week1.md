## Week of Jan 19th 2026

* Set up GitHub repository and local workflow
* Established note-taking split: iPad (thinking) + GitHub (logs)
* Reviewed project goals and Week 1 plan
* Ready to begin CNN fundamentals and hardware mapping
* Read Chapter 1 of Goodfellow (high-level overview)
* Understood training vs inference distinction
* Watched 3Blue1Brown NN video for intuition
* Clarified role of layers and MAC operations
* Completed selective reading of Chapter 6 (forward pass only)
* Solved XOR example using affine transforms, bias, and ReLU across 3 layers
* Reinforced understanding of nonlinearity and layer-wise computation
* Prepared to formalize hardware mapping of neurons and layers
* Mapped XOR affine + ReLU computation to hardware primitives
* Identified DSPs for multiplication and adder trees for accumulation
* Mapped ReLU to comparator + mux logic
* Assigned inputs, weights, bias, partial sums, and outputs to appropriate storage
* Reinforced understanding of nonlinearity and multi-layer necessity
